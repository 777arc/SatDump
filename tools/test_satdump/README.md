# test_satdump

This tool is NOT meant for any end-users, neither most developers. 
It is meant to batch-test SatDump against a very large dataset of recordings, frames, etc to ensure things work and remain functional over time. It may also be useful to detect more subtles bugs happening when repeating a certain task, etc.

But as this is not meant for pretty much anyone else, let's not spend too much time writing this for now :-)

It may be made usable by anyone in the future, but some challenges such as the enormous amount of test data required make this challenging.
