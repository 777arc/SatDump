# NDWI

NDVWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) is a simple enhancement used to monitor changes in water content of leaves using the difference of the two channels used by this enhancement (1.61 and 0.863 µm).

### Appearance

Liquid water appears light blue, including flooding.
Land with vegetation with increasing content of water appears progressively more green.
Deserts appear gray.
Clouds and ambiguous areas appear gray.


### Intended usage

Vegetation analysis, agriculture, crop irrigation, pasture management, forests management.

### Limitations

Cloud dependent.
